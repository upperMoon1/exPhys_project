    <p>Even though you want to dive into an exercise program and get ripped like Rambo, exercise does come with risk if your body isn't ready for high-intensity workouts. Some individuals should check with a physician before they start exercising. Risk factors pertain to one's risk for developing chronic degenerative diseases such as CHD (coronary heart disease). What does this have to do with exercise? Well, when you exercise you put increased stress on your circulatory, pulmonary and metabolic systems. These systems must be fit for the intensity of training you plan on performing.<br><br> If you've ever had a personal trainer or were injured and were sent to a physical therapist while recovering, this might seem familiar. A physical therapist or personal trainer need to assess the level of risk associated with training a client. A client is classified either as low, moderate or high risk. The higher number of risk factors a client has, the more dangerous intense exercise can be for said client.</p>
    <div class="risk-factors-list">
      <p>When classifying a client, a personal trainer should inquire about these three risk factor categories:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Known CV, Pulmonary, Metabolic diseases?</strong></li><br>
        <li><strong> Signs or symptoms of CV, Pulmonary, Metabolic disease?</strong></li><br>
        <li><strong>Two or more cardiac risk factors?</strong><br>cardiac risk factors: age, family history, smoking status, obesity, dyslipidemia, sedentary lifestyle, hypertension, or pre-diabetes.</li>
      </ol>
